#turn GEOID10 back into character, group by origin and destination and sum counts over all the years. Filter to all NC travel (some originate outside NC or end outside NC)
#Note that home_cbgs need to checked against cbgs2010 and GEOID (or destination geoids) need to be checked by 2020 because 2020 data was applied to POI data in create_yearly_safegraph_OD.R
